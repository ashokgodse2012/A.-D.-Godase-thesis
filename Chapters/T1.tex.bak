\section{Literature Review}

Boundary value problems play an important role in pure and applied
mathematics. Rapid development of the theory of boundary value problems over
the past few years has been to a great extent stimulated by the numerous
applications to problems from physics, chemistry, biology, engineering,
economics, social and behavioral sciences, computer sciences and
many other fields.\\
\\ The remarkable development of boundary value problem is due the great mathematicians to Johann
Peter Gustav  Lejeure Dirichlet (1805-1859 ), Carl Neumann, Victor Gustav
Robin  (1855-1897) who contributed considerably to increase the popularity of
boundary value problems.\\
In partial differential equation, an elliptic boundary value problem is
special kind of boundary value problem which can be thought of as the stables
state of an evolution problem.The study of elliptic boundary value problems
is one of the important areas of study and research in the theory of partial
differential equations. In the literature number of methods to study the
elliptic boundary value problems. Some  of them are Maximum principle
technique, Monotone method, Singular perturbation technique etc. However
maximum principles technique is more effective and important technique in
differential equations. The elliptic boundary value problems and maximum
principles go hand in hand is well illustrated in an elegant book by Sperb \cite{sp3}.\\

Theory of differential inequality or Maximum Principles play crucial and
dominant role in the development of different branches of mathematical,
 physical and biological sciences. Now-a-days it is one of the successful
 research area which occupied a central place in study of both nonlinear
 elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations of all orders. This
 principle is a generalization of the elementary fact of calculus that any
 function $f(x)$ which satisfies the inequality $f''  > 0 $ on an interval $[
 a, b]$ takes its maximum value on the boundary of interval. This means
 solutions of inequality $f''  > 0 $ satisfy a maximum principle.
 The maximum principle enables us to obtain information about solution of
differential equations without any explicit knowledge of the solution
themselves. In particular, the maximum principle is a useful tool in the
approximation of solutions, a subject of great interest to many scientist.
One of the reasons for success lies in the fact that, these maximum
 principles provide various information such as   existence, nonexistence,
 uniqueness, continuous dependence and also helps to establish decay results,
 regularity, stability, error bounds both in solid and fluid mechanics. This theme
 is wide spread and highly accepted in order to achieve many new developments in various
 branches of mathematical sciences. The subject of maximum principles is endlessly fascinating,
 remains remarkably active and challenging area of current research despite of its long history.
 Its theory is beautiful, its technique is powerful and its impact upon science is also profound.\\

During the past few years, various researchers have discovered various
maximum principles and their applications. It is noted in Courant $ \& $
Hilbert \cite{c}, Friedman \cite{fr},  Miranda \cite{m1,m2}, Sperb
\cite{sp3},Protter $\&$ Weinberger \cite{pw2}, Gilbarg and Trudinger \cite{gil}, Fraenkel \cite{fn}.\\

Maximum principle technique is successfully applied to various branches of
applied mathematics, such as problems in thin plate theory Mareno
\cite{ma2,ma1}, Komkov \cite{ko}; von Karman plate equation \cite{amo},
Berger \cite{ber}, Berger and Fife \cite{ber2}; reaction diffusion theory,
Sperb \cite{sp1,sp2,sp4}, Pao \cite{pa}; torsional stiffness of a prismatic
bar \cite{an}, oscillation theory,Chan \cite{ch}, Noussair and Swanson
\cite{no} and Dhaigude \cite{db1}; boundary layer theory, Nickel \cite{ni},
Dhaigude and Kasture \cite{dk}; torsional creep, Payne \cite{py1}, Ting
\cite{t}, Payne and Philippin \cite{pp,pp3}; neuclear reactor analysis, Payne
and Stakgold \cite{pst1}; elasticity theory, Payne and Weinberger \cite{pyw},
Philippin \cite{phi}, Payne $\&$ Stakgold \cite{pst2}, Dhaigude and Kasture
\cite{dk} also to obtain bounds, gradient bounds and $L_{2}$ bounds in some
nonstandard problems, Schaefer \cite{scrlp}, Ladyzhenskaya and Uralceva
\cite{lu}, Serrin \cite{se1,se2}, Protter and Weinberger \cite{pw1},
  Sattinger \cite{st}, Bandle \cite{b}, Sperb \cite{sp3}, Payne and Schaefer \cite{ps1}, Stakgold \cite{stk1} etc.\\
Thus there is a well established method of maximum principle for the study of partial differential equations,
 their applications to problems of practical interest.\\
Maximum principle and comparison principle are two sides of same coin. Goyal
and Schaefer \cite{gs} and Dhaigude \cite{db1} studied comparison theorems
for fourth order elliptic equations. Maximum principles for fourth order
elliptic equations are also obtained by Miranda \cite{m2} and Dunninger
\cite{du1} and for nonlinear elliptic equations by Payne \cite{py2}
and Payne and Stakgold \cite{pst1}.\\
 Recently, Goyal $\&$ Goyal \cite{gog}, Schaefer \cite{sc}
developed maximum principles for elliptic equations and obtain bounds for the
solution, gradient and Laplacian of the solution. Mareno \cite{ma}, Nichols
$\&$ Schaefer \cite{nis1}, Goyal $\&$ Schaefer \cite{gs1} developed maximum
principles for a class of fourth order nonlinear elliptic equations. Many
researchers obtained maximum principles for higher order elliptic equation
and discuss uniqueness of the solution for the corresponding boundary value
problem: Danet \cite{d1,d3,d11}, Goyal $\&$ Goyal \cite{gog2}, Schaefer
\cite{sre}, Goyal $\&$ Singh \cite{gs4} etc. Dunninger $\&$ Chow \cite{drc},
Tseng and Lin \cite{tl} obtain apriori bounds for solutions to the constant
coefficient m-metaharmonic equations. Payne and Philippin \cite{pp4}
discussed some maximum principle for nonlinear elliptic equations in
divergence from with applications to capillary surfaces of constant mean
curvature. Bennet \cite{be}, Henrot and Philippin \cite{he} discussed some
overdetermined boundary value problems. A series of papers on maximum
principles appeared with various generalizations and applications of such
maximum principles. See, Payne, Stakgold and Sperb \cite{psts}, Schaefer and
Sperb \cite{ss}and Schaefer \cite{s2}. Secondly existence, nonexistence
properties of solution certain boundary value problem are studied by Schaefer
\cite{s1}as an application of maximum principle.

Maximum principles due to Nirenberg \cite{n} for uniformly parabolic
equations are well established in the literature. Maximum principles due to
Ford and Waid \cite{fw}, Waid \cite{w} for degenerate parabolic operators are
available in the literature.\

A variety of nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations occurs in physical
problems such an examples is thermal boundary layer problem, in the study of
soft tissue etc., discussed in Ramilson and Gebhart \cite{rg}, Holmes
\cite{ho}, Dhaigude and Kasture \cite{dk2}, Sperb \cite{sp1}.


\section{Basic results}
\begin{defn}\nonumber \textbf{Subharmonic function}\\
A function $ u $ is said to be subharmonic (  or subharmonic function ) in $
\Omega$ if it satisfies $ \Delta u \geq  0$ in $ \Omega$.
\end{defn}

\begin{theorem}\label{c1th1.1} \textbf{[ Maximum principle ]} \\
Suppose that $u(x)$ satisfy the differential inequality
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\Delta u \geq 0       \quad \quad \text{in domain} \,\,\Omega.
\end{equation}
If $u$ attains its nonnegative maximum $M$ at any interior point of $\Omega$,
then $ u(x)  \equiv  M  $ in $\Omega$.
\end{theorem}
\newpage
\begin{defn}\nonumber \textbf{Uniformly elliptic operator}\\
The operator
\begin{equation*}
  L   =  \sum^{n}_{i,j = 1}  a_{ij}(x) \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x_{i} \partial x_{j}}
\end{equation*}
is said to be uniformly elliptic in  $ \Omega $ if \\
i) there is a positive quantity $\mu (x)$ such that
\begin{equation*}
  \sum^{n}_{i,j = 1}  a_{ij}(x) \xi_{i} \xi_{j}   \geq   \mu ( x )   \sum^{n}_{i = 1} \xi^{2}{i}
\end{equation*}
holds for each point of $\Omega$ and \\
ii) there is a positive constant $\mu_{0}$ such that $ \mu ( x )  \geq
\mu_{0}$ for all $x$ in $\Omega$.
\end{defn}


In 1927, Hopf's proved the following maximum principle.
\begin{theorem}\label{c1th1.2}  \textbf{[ Hopf's maximum principle ]}\\
Suppose that \\
i) $u(x)$ satisfy the differential inequality
\begin{equation}\nonumber
 ( L + h ) [u]  =  \sum^{n}_{i,j = 1}  a_{ij}(x) u_{x_{i}x_{j}}  +  \sum^{n}_{i = 1} b_{,i}(x) u_{x_{i}}  +  h(x) u \geq  0
\end{equation}
in domain $\Omega$, \\
ii)$ L$ is uniformly elliptic in $\Omega$, \\
iii)the coefficients of $L$ and $h(x)$ are bounded,\\
iv) $h(x)  \leq  0$ in $\Omega$,\\
v) $u$ attain its nonnegative maximum $M$ at an
interior point of $\Omega$. \\
Then
$$ u(x)  \equiv  M   \quad \, \,\text{in} \quad \, \Omega$$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{theorem}\label{c1th1.3}  \textbf{[ Hopf's boundary maximum principle ]}\\
Suppose that \\
i) $u(x)$ satisfy the differential inequality
\begin{equation}\nonumber
 ( L + h ) [u]  =  \sum^{n}_{i,j = 1}  a_{ij}(x) u_{x_{i}x_{j}}  +  \sum^{n}_{i = 1} b_{,i}(x) u_{x_{i}}  +  h(x) u \geq  0
\end{equation}
in domain $\Omega$, \\
ii)$ L $ is uniformly elliptic in $\Omega$, \\
iii)$h(x)  \leq  0$,\\
iv) $u  \leq  M$  in $ \Omega $, that $ u  =  M $ at a boundary point $P$,and
$M \geq  0$, \\
v) point $P$ lies on the boundary of a ball in $ \Omega$, and\\
vi) $u(x)$ is continuous $ \Omega \bigcup P $.\\
Then
$$ \frac{\partial u }{\partial n}   >  0$$   at $P$
unless $$ u(x)  \equiv  M  \quad\,\,  \text{in}  \quad \, \Omega$$.
\end{theorem}

Suppose $ \Omega $ is a plane domain bounded by a sufficiently smooth curve $ \partial \Omega $. \\
In 1948, maximum principle for the function P has proved by Miranda \cite{m2}
\begin{theorem}\label{th1}
Suppose that \\
i) $\Omega$ is plane domain with boundary $\partial \Omega$,\\
ii) $u(x)$ be a sufficiently smooth function satisfying

\begin{equation}\label{r2.1}
  {\Delta}^{2} u = 0  \quad in  \quad \Omega.
\end{equation}\\
Then the function
\begin{equation}\label{r2.2}
P = |\nabla u(x)|^{2} - u \Delta u
\end{equation}
assumes its maximum on $\partial \Omega.$
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}\label{re1}
Payne \cite{py2} noted that
\begin{equation}\label{r2.4}
P = |\nabla u(x)|^{2} - 2 u \Delta u
\end{equation}
cannot assumes its maximum on $\partial \Omega$ if the average curvature of
$\partial \Omega  ( \Omega  \subset {E}^{N},  N \geq 2 )$ is positive and $u$
vanishes on $\partial \Omega$.
\end{remark}

Since then many authors extended the Miranda's result. For example, maximum
principles for fourth order equations containing nonlinearities in $u$ or
$\Delta u $  can be found in the work of Payne \cite{py2}, Schaefer
\cite{s1,sch2,s2}. Similar results have proved by H. Zhang and W. Zhang
\cite{z}, Danet \cite{d11}, Tseng and Lin \cite{tl}, Enache and Philippin
\cite{ep}, Gosavi \cite{go}, Hopf \cite{Hop}, Hille and Protter \cite{hp}
etc.

In the year 1977, Schaefer \cite{s1} extended a maximum principle due to
Miranda \cite{m2} for biharmonic function to the class of fourth order
semilinear elliptic equations of the form
\begin{equation}\label{r2.5}
  {\Delta}^{2} u + \rho(x, y) f(u) = 0
\end{equation}
He consider the same P function given in \eqref{r2.2}.
\begin{theorem}\label{th2}
Suppose that \\
i) $\Omega$ is plane domain with boundary $\partial \Omega$,\\
ii) $u(x)$ be a sufficiently smooth solution of \eqref{r2.5},\\
iii) $\rho$ is a positive function,\\
iv) $f(u)$ is a point function satisfying the condition $uf(u)  <  0$. \\
Then the function
\begin{equation}\nonumber
P = |\nabla u(x)|^{2} -  u \Delta u
\end{equation}

 assumes its maximum on $\partial \Omega.$
\end{theorem}
The above result is also further extended for a different P- function by
Schaefer \cite{s1}. It is stated as follows.
\begin{theorem}\label{th3}
Suppose that \\
i) $\Omega$ is plane domain with boundary $\partial \Omega$,\\
ii) $u(x)$ be a sufficiently smooth solution of \eqref{r2.5},\\
iii) $\rho(x, y )$ is positive function of position with the condition
\begin{equation}
 \Delta \rho  \leq  0 \quad in \quad \Omega  \subset  {E}^{2},
\end{equation}\\
iv) $f(s)$ is the point function satisfying the condition $sf(s)  \geq  0$.\\
Then the function
\begin{equation}\label{r2.6}
 P = \frac{1}{\rho}\bigg[ |\nabla u(x)|^{2}  - u \Delta u   \bigg]
\end{equation}
assumes its maximum on $\partial \Omega $ unless $P < 0$ in $\Omega$.
\end{theorem}



Recently Dhaigude and Gosavi \cite{dg} extend a maximum principle due to
Schaefer \cite{s1} for a class of fourth order semilinear elliptic equations
to a more general fourth order semilinear elliptic equation of the form
\begin{equation}\label{r2.11}
  {\Delta}^{2} u + a(x, y) \Delta u + b(x, y) f(u) = 0.
\end{equation}

\begin{theorem}\label{th6}
Suppose that\\
i) $u(x)$ be a sufficiently smooth solution of \eqref{r2.11} \\
ii) a(x, y)and b(x, y) are bounded in $\Omega$ \\
iii) $a \leq 0, b > 0 $ and \\
\begin{equation}\label{r2.002}
b(x, y)u(x, y)f(u) +  a(x, y)|\nabla u|^{2} \geq 0   \quad \text{in} \quad  \Omega.
\end{equation}
Then the function
\begin{equation}\label{r2.4q}
P = |\nabla u(x)|^{2} -  u \Delta u
\end{equation}
attain its non-negative maximum on  $\partial \Omega.$
\end{theorem}

In 1974, Waid's proved the following maximum principle.

contains $(x_{1}, t_{1}).$\\
Furthermore if $(x_{2}, t_{2})$ is a point of $ \Omega \times (0, T)$  which

\section{Plan of the Thesis}
We organize the thesis as follows.

Chapter 2 is devoted to prove maximum principles for the fourth order
semilinear elliptic equation by auxiliary functions containing the square of
the second gradient of the solution of such equation. The maximum principle
so obtained is used to deduce bounds on important quantities.

In chapter 3 we developed maximum principles for a certain functionals
defined on solution of the fourth order nonlinear elliptic equation. Using
these maximum principles we proved nonexistence of nontrivial solutions of
the fourth order nonlinear elliptic equation with zero boundary conditions.

In chapter 4 using Hopf's maximum principle we obtained maximum principles
for certain functions, which are defined on solutions of the fourth order
elliptic equations.

Chapter 5 is devoted for sixth order elliptic equations. In this chapter we
obtained maximum principles for a class of sixth order elliptic equations by
using auxiliary functions containing the square of the third gradient of
solution of such equations, we conclude this chapter by obtaining integral
bounds for the third gradient of the solution of sixth order elliptic
equation.

In chapter 6 we proved parabolic maximum principles for a certain function,
which is defined on solutions of Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin types of
initial boundary value problems. These maximum principles are utilized to
obtain different bounds for $u_{,t}$.
